**Method 1: Slicing (Most Pythonic)**
```python
text = "hello"
reversed_text = text[::-1]  # "olleh"
```

**Method 2: Using reversed() function**
```python
text = "hello"
reversed_text = "".join(reversed(text))  # "olleh"
```

**Method 3: Using a loop (Educational)**
```python
def reverse_string(text):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        result = char + result
    return result
```

**Which to use?**
- Method 1 (slicing) is fastest and most Pythonic
- Method 2 is more readable for beginners
- Method 3 shows the underlying logic

Try this: reverse your name using slicing!'''
