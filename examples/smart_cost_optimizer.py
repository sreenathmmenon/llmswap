Smart Cost Optimizer - Save 50-90% on LLM API costs

This example shows how llmswap automatically optimizes costs by:
1. Using cache for repeated queries (FREE)
2. Smart provider selection based on query complexity
3. Automatic fallback when providers fail

Perfect for production apps where cost matters!
